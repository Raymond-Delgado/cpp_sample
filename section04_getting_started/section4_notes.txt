-- COMPILER ERRORS --
NOTE: Programing languages have rules
- Syntax Errors: Something wrong with the structure
- Semantic Errors: Something wrong with the meaning

-- COMPILER WARNINGS --
The complier has recognized an issue with your code that could lead to a potential problem.
  - Only a warning because the complier is still able to generate correct machine code 

-- LINKER ERRORS --
Linker is having trouble linking all objects files together to create an executable.
  - Usually there is a library/object file that is missing.

-- RUNTIME ERRORS --
Errors that occur when the program is executing.
Typical runtime errors:
  - Divide by 0
  - File not found
  - Out of memory
Can cause your program to 'crash'
Exception Handling can help deal with runtime errors

-- LOGIC ERRORS --
Errors/Bugs in your code that cause your program to run incorrectly
- Mistakes made by the programmer

-- QUIZ --
 1) [COMPILERS] are used to translate programming language source code instructions into the appropriate machine language instructions.
 2) Integrated Development Environment (IDE) typically includes: [DEEBUGGER, TEXT EDITOR, COMPILER]
 3) A [PROGRAM] is a set of instructions that a computer executes to solve a problem.
 4) Syntax errors are detected by the [COMPILER]
 5) A set of precise steps for solving a problem is known as a(n): [ALGORITHM]
 6) The statements written by programmers are called [SOURCE CODE]
 7) The rules that must be followed when writing programs in specific programming languages are called [SYNTAX]
 8) Mistakes by the programmer that cause a program to produce incorrect results are called [LOGIC ERRORS]
 9) If you declare a variable and use it before initializing it the compiler will generate a(n) [WARNING]
10) The error generated when all the parts that make up a program cannot be put together because one or more are missing is called a [LINKER ERROR]
